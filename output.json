While voting will still take place with these, the team's position is that we should be open to new pools and gauges.  If those gauges are a net negative, the gauges can always be taken away.  However, projects may need the boost to really get started, and may turn into large protocols bringing in large trade fees. It's worth giving projects the chance.  After being added to the system, they still need to gather votes for weight as well.\nAlso not all tokens should be blindly added as well. There should be a sizeable amount of value on the pool with a healthy balance as well as healthy parameters (such as the \"A\" parameter). There could also be issues with the projects themselves, or the token mechanics. For example, tokens with a pricePerFullShare mechanic do not work well with current Curve factory swaps.  There will be a committee of DeFi developers to look at these new gauges and check if they uphold certain requirements.

If all parameters stay exactly the same for a few weeks (TVL, CRV boost, CRV price, CVX price, potential 3rd party incentives), this will eventually turn into the current APR. As that scenario is very unlikely to happen, projected APR should be taken with a grain of salt. Similarly, all fees are already abstracted from this number. \nHow-To Guides - Previous\nClaiming your Airdrop\nNext - FAQ\nContract Addresses\nLast modified 1yr ago"}, "contract-addresses": {"text": "Contract Addresses\nSystem Contracts (Curve System)\nBooster(main deposit contract): 0xF403C135812408BFbE8713b5A23a04b3D48AAE31\nBooster Owner: 0x3cE6408F923326f81A7D7929952947748180f1E6\nVoter Proxy(whitelist contract): 0x989AEb4d175e16225E39E87d0D97A3360524AD80\nMultisig: 0xa3C5A1e09150B75ff251c1a7815A07182c3de2FB\nDeployer: 0x947B7742C403f20e5FaCcDAc5E092C943E7D0277\nCVX: 0x4e3FBD56CD56c3e72c1403e103b45Db9da5B9D2B\ncvxCRV: 0x62B9c7356A2Dc64a1969e19C23e4f579F9810Aa7\nCRV Depositor: 0x8014595F2AB54cD7c604B00E9fb932176fDc86Ae\nReward Factory: 0xEdCCB35798fae4925718A43cc608aE136208aa8D\nToken Factory: 0x3c995e43E6ddD551E226F4c5544C77BfeD147aB9\nStash Factory: 0x877288c4e6EbA4f635bA7428706447353B47De75\nCVX Rewards: 0xCF50b810E57Ac33B91dCF525C6ddd9881B139332\ncvxCRV Rewards: 0x3Fe65692bfCD0e6CF84cB1E7d24108E434A7587e\nPool Manager: 0xc461E1CE3795Ee30bA2EC59843d5fAe14d5782D5\nPool Manager Proxy: 0x5F47010F230cE1568BeA53a06eBAF528D05c5c1B\nPool Manager Secondary Proxy: 0xD20904e5916113D11414F083229e9C8C6F91D1e1\nArbitrator Vault: 0x25E12482a25CF36EC70fDA2A09C1ED077Fc21616\nConvex MasterChef: 0x5F465e9fcfFc217c5849906216581a657cd60605\nVested Escrow: 0xe98984aD858075813AdA4261aF47e68A64E28fCC\nAirdrop Factory: 0xa1Bc2Cf69D474b39B91665e24E7f2606Ed142991\nAirdrop: 0x2E088A0A19dda628B4304301d1EA70b114e4AcCd\nClaim Zap v1: 0x92Cf9E5e4D1Dfbf7dA0d2BB3e884a68416a65070\nClaim Zap v2: 0xDd49A93FDcae579AE50B4b9923325e9e335ec82B\nClaim Zap v3: 0x3f29cB4111CbdA8081642DA1f75B3c12DECf2516\nCVX/ETH SLP: 0x05767d9EF41dC40689678fFca0608878fb3dE906\ncvxCRV/CRV SLP: 0x33F6DDAEa2a8a54062E021873bCaEE006CdF4007\nConvex Multisig: 0xa3C5A1e09150B75ff251c1a7815A07182c3de2FB\nConvex Deployer: 0x947B7742C403f20e5FaCcDAc5E092C943E7D0277\nTreasury Vault: 0x1389388d01708118b497f59521f6943Be2541bb7\nCVX Locker (vlCVX) OLD: 0xD18140b4B819b895A3dba5442F959fA44994AF50\nCVX Locker (vlCVX): 0x72a19342e8F1838460eBFCCEf09F6585e32db86E\nCVXStakingProxy: 0xb5BBC863BAFE5006c68613B89130812a7b586A4e\nvlcvxExtraRewardsOLD: 0xDecc7d761496d30F30b92Bdf764fb8803c79360D\nvlcvxExtraRewards: 0x9B622f2c40b80EF5efb14c2B2239511FfBFaB702\ncvxCRV wrapper: 0xaa0C3f5F7DFD688C6E646F66CD2a6B66ACdbE434\nSystem Contracts (Frax System)\nBooster: 0xA2cF21b157b2f203e37b616b619f438B5aa86Ee5\nVoter Proxy: 0x59CFCD384746ec3035299D90782Be065e466800B\ncvxFXS: 0xFEEf77d3f69374f66429C91d732A244f074bdf74\nfxsDepositor: 0x8f55d7c21bDFf1A51AFAa60f3De7590222A3181e \nFAQ - Previous\nPlatform Rewards: Current vs Projected APR\nNext - FAQ\nFees\nLast modified 26d ago"}, "fees": {"text": "Fees\nConvex Finance Fee Structure\nConvex for Curve \nThere is a 17% total fee on all CRV revenue generated by Curve LP's on our platform.\n10% goes to cvxCRV stakers.

However there is still one known path that uses a series of fake gauges to create fake pools and exploits the shutdown system. We believe this has been sufficiently mitigated as the steps that must be taken are as follows:\nCreate a fake gauge for an existing pool and create an Curve DAO proposal to add said fake gauge\nPass Curve DAO proposal undetected (7 day voting period)\nGive the fake gauge weight on Curve's gauge controller.\nShutdown an existing legit Convex pool. (Curve LP tokens are unstaked and returned to Booster contract)\nAdd a new pool on Convex that uses the fake gauge but legitimate LP tokens\nLoop fake liquidity onto the gauge to increase Convex Deposit Tokens (deposit, withdraw directly from gauge, deposit again)\nCall shutdownSystem() on Pool Manager Secondary Proxy. New pools can no longer be added\nCall queueForceShutdown() on Booster Owner. A normal shutdown call will fail with the fake pool as there are more Convex Deposit Tokens than there are LP tokens, thus need to use this timelock shutdown feature.\nWait 30 days for the timelock to complete\nCall forceShutdownSystem() on Booster Owner\nWithdraw real Curve LP tokens using the illegitimate Convex Deposit Tokens\nWe believe this process which requires a DAO proposal, shutting down a legitimate pool, and waiting for a 30 day timelock should be sufficient mitigation. We are writing this process here as well so that this weakness is known and can be detected.\nFAQ - Previous\nBug Bounties\nLast modified 10mo ago"}}}
